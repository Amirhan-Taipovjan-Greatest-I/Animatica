# Animatica
A Minecraft mod for the Fabric mod loader intended to load the MCPatcher/OptiFine [animated texture format](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/custom_animations.txt). <br/>
## What resource packs does this support?
Animatica adds support for resource packs that use **custom animated textures** <br/>
This includes:
- Animated GUI textures
- Animated entity textures
- Animated block entity textures
- Animated armor textures
- Other animated textures (Animated blocks and items are a vanilla feature)
## Animatica DOES NOT support:
- Fully Custom GUI ([OptiGUI for Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optigui))
- Custom entity models ([CEM for Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-entity-models-cem))
- Custom entity model part animations in 3D ([CEM for Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-entity-models-cem))
- Any other MCPatcher/OptiFine resource pack feature such as connected textures, etc

**These features WILL NEVER be implemented in Animatica.** <br/>
### Animatica is ONLY for ANIMATED TEXTURES.
